## Usage
`air` - By itself drops you into a REPL. Type out an expression and hit <Enter>. Type "exit" to close.
`air help` - opens a simple help screen (probably just this readme)
`air /path/to/file.air` - Evaluates a file if it exists

## Air Language Script
The language itself is just a series of arithmetic expressions that get evaluated down to a single `i32` integer. The
purpose was not to create something useful, but to understand parsing and execution.

The script
```
1 + 1 - (2 + 1 + (3 - 2)) + 12
```
Evaluates to `10`. The expression is evaluated from the innermost parentheses outward.

### Supported Operators
- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/` (this rounds the result to an integer)
- `^x` (raises to a power)

**Only whole numbers are supported. No floating points**
