# Air Language
This is a few-hours attempt at creating an interpreter from scratch for a made-up scripting language. No Virtual Machine,
no true compiler, and no optimizations. Just a simple interpreter to parse and execute simple math expressions.

**Please don't use for anything you care about. I guarantee this has bugs and terrible error handling.**

## Air Language Script
Called "air" because it sounds a little like the first part of "arithmetic". Also, I will use any excuse to sneak in
some *Last Airbender* reference ðŸ¥²

The language itself is just a series of arithmetic expressions that get evaluated down to a single `i32` integer. The
purpose was not to create something useful, but to understand parsing and execution.

The script
```
1 + 1 - (2 + 1 + (3 - 2)) + 12
```
Evaluates to `10`. The expression is evaluated from the innermost parentheses outward. No operator precedence.

See `tests/integration.rs` for some examples.

### Supported Operators
- `+`
- `-`
- `*`
- `/` (this rounds the result to an integer)
- `^x` (raises to a power)

**Only whole numbers are supported. No floating points**

## CLI Usage
- `air` - By itself drops you into a REPL. Type out an expression and hit <Enter>. Type "exit" to close.
- `air help` - opens a simple help screen (probably just this readme)
- `air /path/to/file.air` - Evaluates a file if it exists

There is no support for pretty error messages. Just panics if something goes wrong.

## Roadmap
If I get done with that, or ever revist the project, I would

- Allow for sets of number `[1, 2, 3]` with operators `+[1, 2, 3] = 6`
- Allow for labels (like variables) and multiple lines `a = 1 + 2 / 3; b = 4^2; b - a` would return the last statement
- Include increment and decrement operators (++ and --)

That's really it. My next project is to build a rudimentary Virtual Machine and actual Turing Complete toy language, so
that's where I would get into scope, function, and all the rest.
